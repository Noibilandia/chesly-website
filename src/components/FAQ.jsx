      question: 'Which messaging apps does Chesly support?',
      answer: 'Chesly integrates with 10+ apps including Slack, Gmail, WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and Microsoft Teams. We\'re actively adding more integrations during development.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What can Chesly\'s AI do?',
      answer: 'Chesly\'s AI helps you stay on top of messages by extracting highlights and action items, summarizing long threads, and learning what\'s urgent based on your rules. You control what it focuses on: mentions, deadlines, key senders, and topics you care about.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is my message data secure and private?',
      answer: 'Security is our top priority. Chesly uses end-to-end encryption, and AI data is processed on our servers so your data never leaves our infrastructure or trains third‑party models.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I reply to messages directly from Chesly?',
      answer: 'Yes! You can reply to Slack messages, emails, WhatsApp, and more without leaving Chesly. Your replies are sent through the original platform, so the conversation continues naturally.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the free trial work?',
      answer: 'Start with a 14-day free trial of our Pro plan. No credit card required. You\'ll have access to Pro features like AI insights, smart notifications, and AI-powered search, plus all integrations. Downgrade to Free or upgrade to Team anytime.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will Chesly work with my company\'s existing tools?',
      answer: 'Chesly is designed to work alongside your existing setup. It connects to your apps via official APIs and doesn\'t require any changes to how your team currently uses Slack, email, or other tools.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I customize which notifications I receive?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. You can set rules based on sender, app, keywords, time of day, and more. Want AI insights for Slack but instant notifications for email from your boss? You can configure that.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does Chesly have mobile apps?',
      answer: 'Yes! We have native apps for iOS and Android that sync seamlessly with the desktop version. Your unified inbox and AI features are available wherever you are.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How is Chesly different from email clients with unified inbox?',
      answer: 'Traditional unified inboxes just aggregate messages. Chesly goes further with AI features, smart notification batching, cross-app search, and the ability to reply to any platform from one place. Plus, we support way more than just email.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use Chesly with my team?',
      answer: 'Yes! Our Team plan includes shared inboxes, so your whole team can collaborate on customer messages, support requests, or any shared communication. Admin controls let you manage access and permissions.',
